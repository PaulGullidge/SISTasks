# SIS Front end

I've not used React previously (although I have used other front end technologies), but I wanted to
demonstrate that I am capable of delivering work irrespective of the underlying technologies and that I learn
new technologies when needed.  In the last few days I've been reading the React_Quickly (2nd edition) book and making use of the internet help to deliver this solution to you.

I appreciate that the solution is not perfect, for example I have not got the components seperated as nicely as I should have to work with tables, but I hope you can see the effort that has gone in and I feel the end result is a reasonable demonstration that I can work with all differnt kinds of technologies as required.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- node.js
Vesion 20.12.2  

## Installation 

Created a new project using the following command:
> npx create-react-app sis-front-end

Download my sis-front-end project into a seperate folder and copy the src directory into the root folder of the project that you created (the files in my src directory should be added to the files in the project''s src directory).

## Usage

from the created project directory (sis-front-end) enter the following command:
>npm start

This should launch a browser pointed to the application.  The application should start on port 3000 so please make sure that port is not in use
