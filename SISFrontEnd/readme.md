# SIS Front end

I've not used React previously (although I have used other front end technologies), but I wanted to
demonstrate that I am capable of delivering work irrespective of the underlying technologies and that I learn
new technologies when needed.  In the few days I've been reading the React_Quickly (2nd edition) book and making use of the internet help to deliver this solution to you.

I appreciate that the solution is not perfect, for example I have not got the components seperated as nicely as I should have to work with tables, but I hope you can see the effort that has gone in and I feel the end result is a reasonable demonstration that I can work with all differnt kinds of technologies.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- node.js
Vesion 20.12.2  

## Installation 

Created a new project using the following command:
> npx create-react-app sis-front-end

Download my sis-front-end project and copy the files and directories into the appropriate folder of the project that you created

## Usage

from the created project directory (sis-front-end) enter the following command:
>npm start

This should launch a browser pointed to the application.  The application should start on port 3000 so please make sure that port is not in use
