# SIS Front end

I've not used react previously (although I have used other front end technologies), but I wanted to
demonstrate that I am capable of delivering work irrespective of the underlying technologies and I learn
new technologies when needed.  In the last couple of days I've been reading the React_Quickly (2nd edition) book and making use of the internet help to deliver this solution to you.

I appreciate that the solution is not perfect, for example I have not got the components seperated as nicely as I should have to work with tables, but I hope you can see the effort that has gone in and I feel the end result is a reasonable demonstration that I can work with all differnt kinds of technologies and I am keen to learn.
